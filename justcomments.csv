It sure is. 

Metallic levels were supposed to correlate to a risk pool and the expected level of coverage for such a pool. IMO it's unfortunate that the naming convention (catastrophic-platinum) and arcane rules re: cost accumulation (towards deductibles, out of pocket maximums etc.) led to people believing that they should get a higher metallic level plan even though a lower one would have been more appropriate.
