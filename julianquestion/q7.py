# supervised ML


# clustering with subsets of the data 


# aggregated by user sentiment analysis x user aggregated activity on subreddits


# potenitally interesting clustering if possible (not needed)


# MOVING FORWARD USING CHAT TO GIVE LABELS THEN USING OUR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AS A FEATURE COMBINED WITH ALL OUR OTHERS FOR CLASSIFICATION/PREDICTING CHAT LABEL
#(also we can remove rows where chat thinks there is not an indicator of sentiment )


#then we can actually do train test split on that 


#do this for comments and titles


# justification about using chatgpt explain our process




#something else interesting we could do polynomial regression on it to predict magnitudes (food for thought not needed to do EXTRA)
