#### Virtual environment and downloading required packages
1. Do once: create a virtual environment

  - Navigate to your project directory
  $`cd path/to/your/project`

  - Create virtual environment 
  $`python3 -m venv venv`   
  Second 'venv' is the name of the folder, can be anything

2. Activate virutal environment every time you use this project
   
    $`source ~/venv/bin/activate`
  
3. The virtual environment is working when you see (venv):
   
   (venv) user@computer:~/project$
   
4. Do occasionally: Install from requirements.txt
   
    $`pip install -r requirements.txt`
