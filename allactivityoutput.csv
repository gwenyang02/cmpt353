WhiteLycan,d5g67pz,"&gt;As I said ISIS wants to do things that are abhorrent even to other Muslims, yet they still manage to get these particular crazies. 

That's not the case though. In an Orlando mosque, a speaker said that the compassionate thing to do was to kill the homosexuals. If moderate muslims are so opposed to ISIS, why are they relatively silent every time a muslim commits acts of terror? Why do they instead hide behind the anti-gun lobby. 

&gt;Even if someone rewrote the Qur'an today not only would it not get rid of ISIS some of these people would continue to believe as they pleased.

Absolutely. The problem is the religious practice at large is still largely 8th century. There are sharia zones in Sweden. You want to talk integration? Why are there sharia zones? Only the United States moderate muslims seem to have any semblance to being moderate and that's only if you'll excuse them for attacking Sam Harris's collaborator.

You can already sue publications for printing misinformation about you. ""Open up the libel laws"" could easily turn into ""make publications liable if my brand is hurt by their reporting, honest or not."" While it's true that currently such cases are hard to win, it's designed that way. 

&gt;No federal libel law currently exists, because libel suits are handled in state courts.

&gt;Since 1964, when the Supreme Court ruled on ""New York Times vs. Sullivan,"" public individuals who wish to sue media companies for libel are required to prove that the news organization knowingly published false information with malicious intent.

On point two regarding Hillary's e-mails, an FBI investigation found that she committed no crime, *because* there was no intent. It's not comparable to speeding, which is a crime that does not require intent. After the FBI has investigated and said that there's not enough to prosecute, Trump has said he would take up the investigation against a person that would effectively be a private citizen if she lost. 

The real danger is Trump using the resources of the presidency against a political opponent. Imagine he's up for re-election, and he uses the FBI to launch an investigation into a Democratic or even Republican primary challenger. It's reminiscent of Nixon using the FBI to try and cover up the Watergate break-in and other actions by his ""plumbers.""

On the killing the families of terrorists thing, I read your link, and I think it ignores some of reality. The poster argues A. that innocent people die in war and B. that the families of terrorists are frequently complicit in terrorism.

On point A, there is a huge difference between collateral damage and deliberately targeting civilians. One is an unfortunate result of warfare, the other is a war crime. Targeting civilians, who offer no strategic, tactical, or political advantage, is not only extremely unethical, but also makes for stellar PR for ISIS and other terrorist groups. 

On point B, the poster uses anecdotal evidence about the San Bernadino shooters assembling bombs in the basement belonging to one of their mothers. But this one example does not mean that all family members of terrorists are complicit in acts of terrorism. Is the two month old baby a terrorist if his father joins ISIS? Do you blow the baby and his mother up with a drone in the name of the ""war on terror?"" 

One of the commenters also misquotes Trump, saying that we need to ""deal with them,"" but that's not what Trump said. He said ""we have to take out their families,"" as evidenced in this [this clip](https://youtu.be/I1eXRXL0nkk?t=99). 

Yes, terrorists target civilians. But if we start *targeting* houses that we know to have non-combatants in them, just women and the children in their cribs, then we become that which we despise. We would become terrorists. 

I think his praise of Saddam Hussein, along with other dictators like the leaders of China during Tienanmen Square and Vladimir Putin is a sign that he values strength above all else, including things like diplomacy, honor, and following the rules of modern warfare. 

&gt;Large-scale terror attack **every freaking month!**

I understand your concern about terrorism, but in the United States Islamic-inspired terrorism is not as big of a threat as many people make it out to be.

I found [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States#2010.E2.80.93present) wikipedia article to be a very interesting read about instances of terrorism in the US over the last couple decades. You can scroll all the way down to the bottom and see that the number of terrorist attacks committed by ""radical Islamic terrorists"" is pretty low. It's easy to let fear dominate your viewpoint in the aftermath of an attack like the one in Nice, but it's important to keep it all in perspective. 

&gt;Hillary's actions in Libya

I always find this one a particularly odd line of a attack. [Trump was a big fan of intervention in Libya back when the war was ongoing](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/flip-flop-trump-admits-suppoted-libya-intervention-article-1.2662238), and even today he admits that he would have approved a ""surgical"" attack, despite his comments during the primary about how much ""better off"" Libya would be if Gaddafi were in charge.

Furthermore, it's important to remember that, on the eve of NATO intervention, Gaddafi was about to storm Benghazi, the resistance capital. He went on national television and swore to hunt down every last resident of the city ""like rats,"" and kill them. Gaddafi was also responsible for sponsoring terrorist attacks against American soldiers during the waning days of the Cold War. He was scum, and many more lives might have been lost if he had been allowed to remain in power. Our exit strategy for Libya was terrible, but the intervention itself is very justifiable. 

&gt;Racial tensions, sure they were there before. But did we have black men targeting and killing white cops like today?

The attack in Dallas was an act of terrible, and every reasonable person grieves for the loss of those officers. With that being said, racial tensions in America are vastly better than they were 100-200 years ago. [Thousands, literally thousands, of black men and women were lynched by mobs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/history-of-lynchings-in-the-south-documents-nearly-4000-names.html?_r=0). It's easy to get lost in that statistic, so since I read through the r/The_Donald thread you linked to, I hope you will be generous enough to read the story of [Sam Hose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hose). He shot his boss in self-defense over a wage dispute, but was wrongly accused of raping his boss' wife. He was hunted down and dragged to a tiny city in Georgia, then kept in the local jail cell. The papers in Atlanta advertised that he would be lynched, and the train companies ran special trains to the town in order to accommodate two *thousand* spectators. It was Sunday morning, these people skipped church to watch this man be dragged from his cell, beaten, castrated, murdered, and then have his body parts auctioned off for sale. 

The point of the story is not to shock you into thinking that things are perfect now, but to highlight that racial tensions have come a tremendously long way in the last 100 years. Did we have people chanting ""death to the cops?"" No, but we had thousands of people who gathered to watch and cheer on a murder, and Sam Hose was just one example. For a more recent example, remember that MLK was assassinated, and before that his home was bombed (Also, don't imagine that blacks alone were targeted, white supporters, or ""n*gger lovers,"" were also targeted by the KKK and other white supremacist groups). 

&gt;America is not as respected as it once was

The evidence you provide for this assertion is, without meaning to offend, trivial. Yes, Russian jets get too close to our own aircraft. Yes, China openly disputes the ownership of islands in the Pacific (though those disputes are with Japan and Taiwan, not the US). But again, if you look through American history, the war of 1812 was started in part because British ships were capturing American vessels and forcing Americans into service on those ships. Less than 100 years ago, the German commander of forces in Western Europe dismissed the entry of America into WWI as ""as a bunch of soft doughboys."" No one in the world could possibly dispute that America is the most powerful nation in the history of the world, with territory that exceeds Genghis, economic dominance greater than the height of Rome, and cultural influence unrivaled in the modern era. 

I hope none of this came off as preachy, but when Trump says ""Make America Great Again,"" you have to wonder exactly what time period he's talking about.  ",politics,t5_2cneq,1468799315,2016,7

Incredibly quiet. Disproportionately quiet. Why is it that only two imams (that I saw) came out to condemn Mateen? We have how many mosques in the United States and only two imams felt it necessary to point out that Omar Mateen was a bad muslim?

&gt;To put it another way: you're a moderate Imam. How do you call in an atheist, who has claimed that Muslim schools should be shut down (I don't even want to go to a Muslim school and I can see how this would rankle, especially with Americans and their freedom-boner) to come and convince anyone of anything? Especially since we're not talking about a politician or someone in charge of this issue.

The atheist's job is to convince the muslims that they live in a country in which all cultures are celebrated, but no culture reigns supreme. That's it. If the atheist can get out the message of tolerance that's plenty. (By the way, if the muslim school is private, they shouldn't be shut down. If they're public, they should. This is the separation of church and state in effect).

&gt;Like, Sam Harris believes that you're deluded. If he's treating you with kid gloves now it's only cause he believes you pose a particular threat. But, at the end of the day, he'd rather your beliefs just be gone

Sam Harris has never said this. He has said moderate muslims should be embraced and if there is any moderate muslim that wants to migrate to the United States that they should have expedited processing. 

&gt;In fact, Sam Harris has gone so far as to say this himself I think. He's just not the guy to make the argument to not just the people within America but to the world.

See above: You can see interviews with Sam Harris in which he states that muslims are not a problem. Islam is.
