A ways back I came across some kind of firearm - a carbine, I think - that had something kind of like the SIG Brace, but it wasn't exactly the same.

Unfortunately I cannot figure out what on earth it was.  Any idea?   It was rather funky looking.

Ideally it would be able to comfortably hold at least 5+ boxes of shells. 

It would also be nice if it had a recoil pad. Has anyone had experience with a recoil pad on a vest making any noticeable difference?

It would also have two front pockets and probably a big back pocket or opening.

In Australia, we have a federal election coming up that has raised an important question about candidate placement on ballot forms.

The senate here randomly allocates parties left to right on the ballot. Some controversial groups such as Family First (A religious party) and the Health Australia Party (An anti-vaxx party) have drawn 1st positions in some states.

Do these placements have a significant impact? or is it generally a non-issue?
