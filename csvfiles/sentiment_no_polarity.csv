If you did marry with a quick ceremony at the courthouse in the US, you could go home and immediately start the paperwork for a CR-1 spouse visa.
This would allow you to start working as soon as you arrive in the US, and the lead time would be similar to the K1 visa, but without waiting around for work authorization.

If your man has been living in the UK for the last 6 months, you can file at the UK embassy and the process should take 4 to 6 months.
